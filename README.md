# AccelerometerViewer
This repo is intended to demonstrate some of GPT-4's capabilities as well as serve as a proving ground to develop a workflow that incorporates it into the software engineering process.

100% of the code within this repo was either generated by GPT-4 or is stubs/boilerplate generated by xCode or Android studio when creating a new project.
 
# iOS
Multiple attempts have been made to try and get to a fully functional app that meets the initial features prompted.

## 001 - Bing GPT-4 Line Graphs & Bar Chart
This attempt was using Bing GPT-4 in Creative mode. The result is incomplete as I was trying to see what could be achieved within the 20 prompt limit for Bing GPT-4.

Lessons Learned:
    - when using Bing GPT, it's best to keep the number of features limited. If I didn't include the bar graphs, I think I would have had enough prompts to get it working fully.
    - only ask it to fix a single bug at a time. The first mention of no visible line or bar graphs was ignored and it zeroed in on the last bug mentioned in the prompt.
    - asking it to list the file structure was very useful
    - high specificity in the reported errors yielded good results in the generated fixes
